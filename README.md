# Image Filtering in Spatial and Frequency Domain

This project demonstrates various image filtering techniques in both spatial domain and frequency domain. The filters applied help in tasks such as noise reduction, edge detection, and image enhancement,

## Project Structure
This repository is structured into multiple branches that demonstrate different filtering techniques.
Branches:
1) spatial-domain

   Focuses on image filtering techniques in the spatial domain such as Gaussian blurring, sharpening, and edge detection.
2) frequency-domain

   Demonstrates the use of frequency domain filters such as the Fourier Transform and various low/high-pass filters.
